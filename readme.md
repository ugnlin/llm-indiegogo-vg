# Kickstarter Game LLM Scraper Predictor

quick little project to try the following things:
- Scrape games off of kickstarter
- Use LLaMa to engineer a bunch of features (fine tuning/direct prediction will take too long but could also be fun 
another time)
- Do the standard data science prediction pipeline to predict % of original goal funded

I chose this project to show off my scrappy agile python skills. I have actual professional experience in my field, so
I'm just looking to do a technical project here. The domain is for fun, to keep me motivated to build this out as I'm
expecting it just to be for personal gain!
