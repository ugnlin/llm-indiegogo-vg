2,1093618,GT Traveler - Android based Live Interpreter,"All those times 
 How many times you were going on holiday in a country where you do not know the language and to communicate you used a dictionary? Or better yet, how many times would you be able to speak that language, without having to study for years? 
 I bet you even tried many times to use your smartphone, but sometimes the roaming costs as much as the hotel room or even more. 
 Now, you can talk to anyone from everywhere...with the push of a button. 
 Don't you like that idea? 
 What is Our Solution 
 With the latest updates, the translation apps are doing all those translations that we need, but most of times they need an internet connection..and if you use your smartphone to take pictures too then your battery will be dried out faster than you'd expect. 
 Our solution is GT Traveler, an Android based Live Interpreter that uses the Google technology to translate simultaneously the conversation that you have with another language native speaker. 
 No display, no useless apps or features, only what's necessary to communicate...and a big battery that could last days between charges. 
 The Result 
 From now on, with Gt Traveler, you'll be able to express yourself everywhere in the world without using big and annoying dictionaries or smartphone apps that leave you without phone battery. 
 The GT Traveler translated simultaneously from and to English and other language as: German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Japanese and many more 
 From now on... 
 ...you'll be able to say ""vorrei in caffe macchiato ed un cornetto"" without knowing a bit of Italian, or ""Esta plaza es muy Hermosa"" without knowing to speak Spanish. 
 Awesome, right?!

3,584822,Afterglow Miniatures Game: Forsaken,"The Afterglow Miniatures Miniatures Game is a tabletop strategy game designed for two or more players, set in a grim world devastated by an apocalypse. 
 Players lead bands of survivors who clash against each other in a struggle for survival among the ruins of towns, burned-out wastelands and underground bunkers. 
 The game, based on the 
 intuitive mechanics, 
 is 
 fast and dynamic. 
 Depending on the format it takes 
 from 40 to 90 minutes 
 to play, while the number of miniatures in warbands varies 
 from 4 to 20 models 
 , depending on the chosen faction. 
 Afterglow is different from many other wargames. First of all, 
 it is a game of survival 
 . Victory is not always on the side of those who deal the biggest damage to the opponent. 
 S 
 cenarios and Mission Cards 
 provide an opportunity to win the game without firing a single shot, relying on the player's intelligence, strategic planning skills, anticipation of opponent's moves and clever use of unit skills and abilities. 
 We have also 
 created a system of playing campaigns 
 - connected scenarios, during which members of your warbands can gain experience, develop skills, plunder and find new equipment, but also sustain permanent injuries, fall victim to diseases and mutations or eventually die. 
 The game is becoming increasingly popular in Poland. For over a year we have been organizing meetings and tournaments, where you can meet many amazing people and test yourself as leader of a post-apocalyptic gang. Now we would like to present Afterglow to players and miniatures enthusiasts in other countries. 
 Download free beta rules and take part in the open tests. 
 At the moment 
 five factions are available 
 for Afterglow MG. Each of them delivers a different playing style and aesthetic feel. 
 Now we would like to offer you the sixth faction, 
 long awaited by many Afterglow players and fans. 
 Forsaken 
 are rejects of post-apocalyptic societies. Their ranks include outlaws, mutants, cannibals and those infected with the Black Mouth disease. 
 Forsaken are driven by rage. They attack with unusual ferocity and brutality, showing no mercy nor compassion. Their sole motivation is to fight, plunder and feast on their victims. This is a faction focused on an offensive playing style and close quarters fighting. 
 The main goal of this campaign is to release the Starter Set for a new Afterglow faction - Forsaken. 
 A Forsaken Faction Starter Set is not all we can offer you. If your support reaches levels indicated below, we will be able to release even 
 more Afterglow miniatures and accessories 
 .

4,1117978,Vector Jiu-Jitsu:    Breaking the Cycle,"Who are we? 
 Founded by a husband and wife team of teachers, the Vector Jiu-Jitsu program (in Jackson, Mississippi) has been forging wildly fruitful mentoring relationships with children battling a devastating cycle of poverty, crime and violence in their beloved neighborhoods for the past 2 years. 
 Nikari is just one example of these fruitful relationships.  When he began training in the Vector Jiu-Jitsu program, he was an 18 year old sophomore in high school with no interest in graduation.  An innately gifted young man, with a father in prison, and a family struggling with poverty, Nikari was plagued by depression. 
 With the martial arts training and mentoring guidance he was empowered with in Vector, Nikari is now the first male high school graduate in his family's history.  He's enrolled in college, eagerly seeking to be one of Vector Jiu-Jitsu's first 
 paid interns 
 as we seek to expand this powerful impact to youngsters around the City of Jackson! 
 ""Make an effort, not excuses.""  has become his mantra. 
 What do we do? 
 Our program motto is: KNOW YOURSELF, BETTER YOURSELF & HELP OTHERS 
 KNOW YOURSELF 
 :  Training in martial arts (in particular, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) uniquely allows students to learn more about who they are and what they are capable of.  Training reveals truth, pure, inescapable truth about oneself. This is an opportunity rarely enjoyed in today's world. 
 BETTER YOURSELF 
 :  Whether it be discipline, health, or academics - the children of Vector Jiu-Jitsu must confront personal shortcomings and demand better from themselves.  They are held accountable for these improvements by adult mentors who spend approximately 10 hours a week with them, either in training, tutoring or general socialization. 
 HELP OTHERS 
 :  Children in the program constantly serve their community.  Neighborhood beautification, organic gardening, assistance to the elderly and various other outreach efforts are constantly evolving for our students to internalize the great satisfaction of a service lifestyle. 
 (showing our classmates and Principal how to make fresh juice at school) 
 Why Vector Jiu-Jitsu? 
 The children of Jackson are not safe walking home & the academic achievement gap grows daily.  Despite millions being spent in education...too many young ones with vast intellectual potential have failed to find an identity or source of personal pride outside of the comfort of gang-life or scholastic malaise. 
 Lacking powerful, positive adult influences, many children will remain unable to make the proper choices to set their lives up for success. 
 With your help, Vector Jiu-Jitsu will service more & younger children in the city.  We can provide 500+ children with a 
 permanent 
 outlet for physical, mental and emotional development. 
 WE  BELIEVE  WE  CAN  CHANGE  A  CITY.... DO  YOU?

 Updates 
 #1: 
 Development Update 1 
 Life of Rome is a third and first-person massively multiplayer online action role playing game (MMORPG) set in 320AD Rome. The game is played from the point of view of both Roman and Barbarian; designed to emphasise roleplay and community using a faction system and player-driven politics. The in-game world is a 50km2 representation of Rome and its surrounding areas, including several small villages and Roman forts. 
 We are an independent team called Breakout Studio, passionate to create a game we’ve been wanting to play. The game started development in February 2014, since then we’ve been following feedback from the community. This has helped us to build and adapt our roadmap to create a game we all want to play. 
 Players interact with each other in a series of locations spread across the area. Major roleplaying-based storylines, purely optional, will be started and run by Breakout Studios staff as well as players. Players in a position of power may also affect gameplay by setting a faction’s agenda, creating long-term political, economic, or military goals, which are broken up into missions handed down through a faction’s hierarchy in the form of player generated and driven missions. 
 Factions & Race 
 Race and Faction are entirely separate choices. All races can choose allegiance to the Roman State or to the Barbarian Rebels. Race is more of a cultural choice and will come with a unique faith option and prestige item. Race will largely be a matter of roleplay and how you choose to play your character. 
 Faction allegiance is something that can be chosen at the beginning of your journey, however allegiance can be switched although this comes with a heavy Prestige debuff and it not something you can do on a daily basis. You are able to make a pledge of allegiance to either faction, and not make another one for a game year, or month, or reasonable period of time. 
 Crafting 
 To have all of the things you need and want, players will have to travel around the world and interact with others positively or negatively – In turn this will encourage travel and trade for both factions. This will stimulate politics within factions, as well as against the opposing faction. Having resources spread across the map will encourage crafting specialisation. 
 Real Time Combat 
 Unlike many traditional MMORPG’s, we’re approaching combat as organically as possible. We want to give the player a chance to learn, adapt and increase their skills in combat through realistic training. Timing will be crucial – when you attack, block or dodge will determine survival, as well as the power you put behind an attack and how close you stand to the enemy. 
 Your actions will effect your Prestige. If you are Roman allegiance, enemy kills will increase prestige, but killing your own faction will decrease it. Barbarian allegiance will  receive prestige for combat regardless of whether they kill Romans or Barbarians. Your prestige will be the sum of all of your parts, all of your skills, stats, attributes, faith bar, and valuable possessions in game such as armour, weapons, livestock, fine clothing, jewellery and decorative items and any land you own, money, titles you hold and reputations you have. Prestige can also be the measure of whether you are classed as a noble or a plebeian for Romans and a Noble or a Freeman for Barbarians. 
 Religion 
 This mechanic can reflect real practices performed by ancient people, brought into game as a way of boosting craft specialisation, and as part of a faith and healing system. High faith will also contribute to your overall Prestige score. Faith drains very slowly and would be a more long term goal than others. 
 A player would raise their faith bar by praying to particular gods, or by making offerings or sacrifices at their home fire, the town fire or a temple. In return sometimes their prayers will be heard by the gods (by chance, depending on how high a person’s faith is, where and what has been offered) they will receive a temporary bonus, related to the god they made the offering to, which will affect a particular crafting operation, combat, one of their attributes or stats, or bars. 
 Weather 
 The world features a full 24 hour day & night cycle complete with a range of dynamic weather effects. It renders physically based realtime atmospheric scattering, dynamic wind speed & direction and continuous dynamic moon phases. 
 Your characters ‘Comfort’ can be affected by the weather – staying sheltered during rain or keeping warm during the night will help keep your comfort level’s normal. This also applies to the suitability of the clothes you are wearing for the the task at hand, for example – working a furnace may decrease comfort, but visiting the bathhouse or taverna afterwards will negate the effects. 
 Oculus Rift 
 Life of Rome 
 supports the Oculus Rift head-mounted display (HMD), the first video footage of the game running on an Oculus DK2 shows brief snippets of the Roman architecture and characters. Recorded from a first-person perspective, it gives an idea of how the game looks and feels from the eyes of a Roman character.

 We're 
 Sports Passport 
 . Since 2013, we've offered baseball, basketball and football fans a simple, fun and competitive way to keep track of every game they've attended. 
 With our websites, fans can log old ticket stubs, view teams' records and top player performances when they've been in attendance, create stadium bucket lists, and compete with other fans in arena-chasing challenges. 
 Hardball Passport 
 , 
 Basketball Passport 
 and

 But there's something missing. Sports Passport currently covers three of the four major U.S. sports. Completing the square is where you come in. 
 It's A Great Day For Hockey 
 Hockey is a sport that requires serious devotion. Whether you're up north digging a car out of a January blizzard to get to the arena, or down South counting down to NHL Opening Day while everyone else is in football mode, love for the game is never skin-deep. For the past two years, hockey lovers have wanted a Passport of their own. We heard you. This summer, we want you to help us finally make Puck Passport a reality. 
 Great Moments Are Born From Great Opportunity 
 Puck Passport will provide everything that Hardball, Basketball and Football Passports already provide, but with a lot more slapshots and high sticking. Like our other products, we'll cover: 
 Where You've Been: 
 a comprehensive game database from 1980 to present 
 Where You Are: 
 game check-ins and a local game locator 
 Where You're Going: 
 arena bucket lists, competitive arena-chasing challenges and three-click road trip planning 
 Puck Passport will be the serious hockey fan's digital shoebox of ticket stubs, a community for collecting and sharing memories and photographs, and a way to plan a hockey road trip to test even the strongest marriage. There will be no place quite like it. 
 Put The Biscuit In The Basket 
 We are seeking at least $7,000 in funding to make Puck Passport happen in time for the 2015-16 NHL season. Those funds will go towards: 
 Design and construction of the user interface 
 Graphic design of the site's visual elements 
 Research and development of a database that doesn't exist yet: a statistically detailed, geotagged collection of every NHL game since 1980 
 Daily updates during the 2015-16 season via a reliable paid stats feed 
 Once you've helped us get off the ground, Puck Passport will remain healthy and financially viable with the help of our paid premium product. For an annual fee, Passport Plus lets travelers view personalized, detailed, shareable player stats. Which player has the most goals when you're in attendance? Penalty minutes, saves, assists? Plus gives you the answers. 
 You Miss 100% Of The Shots You Don't Take 
 Our primary challenge is time. We are beginning this campaign in late June, and the NHL season begins October 7. That gives us 100 days to raise funds, pay contractors, build databases, beta-test the site, and launch. Nobody said hockey was easy. 
 If we raise less than 
 $7,000 
 , we will launch the site in a limited fashion: three years' worth of game data and no Plus features. We will reopen fundraising and aim to launch the remainder of the features by the NHL All-Star Game. 
 If we raise less than 
 $3,000 
 , we will delay the entire Puck Passport launch, keep fundraising open, and aim to launch for the 2016-17 season. 
 If we raise less than 
 $1,000 
 , we'll return the funds and this never happened, just like the 2004-05 NHL season. (Sorry, still too soon.) 
 If we end up exceeding our goal, however, we will add features like NCAA and/or Canadian Junior league games. The bigger our database is, the better the site will be, and the more fun we'll be able to offer Puck Passport's registered travelers. 
 The Final Flick 
 Thank you for considering supporting our project. We're looking forward to use our experience and track record to build a fun, exciting resource for anyone who loves the game of hockey.

9,1493309,Adventure RPG where YOU control your experience!,"Short Summary 
 When I was a teen, I played many browser based RPG games, but one in particular is what fueled me to learn how to code my own. The owner of that game never talked to most of his players and only logged on to take donations and then left. It was then I vowed I could do better. I taught myself how to code and made my own game where I actually interacted with my players, making lasting friendships with people who still play my game 8 years later, through all of the different versions. Being in poverty my whole life, I could never afford hosting for my game consistently, meaning I had to stop and start over a lot. I am finally at a point in my life where I can afford stable hosting and invest in my game, where I want each and every player to know I'm available and I want them to have a great gaming experience, one that molds to their choices, one where there are always multiple choices and you are never stuck on one path if you change your mind after a choice. I want my game to be the player's game, too. I wach each player to know their game experience is different than anothers. To do this, I need help raising money to invest more time and resources. 
 What We Need & What You Get 
 To begin, we're raising $500 to put towards hosting, development, and most importantly, the look of the game. We are in talks with a pixel artist who will create the characters, items, icons and more needed for an aesthetically pleasing gameplay experience. No one wants to stare at text and buttons all the time. Our players want to see that epic sword they just looted off of a dungeon boss. Our players want to see what their character looks like now that they bought and equipped that awesome new blue mohawk they just purchased from the premium store. Our players want to see that special icon that only a Game Master has next to their name in chat and the forums. We need to add imagery that shows just how exciting that new NPC is in town that is selling the awesome items you can now see the icons to! 
 The Impact 
 Since the day I started to learn how to code, creating an excellent and addictive gameplay experience for anyone who played my game has been my dream. This campaign will allow me to bring so much more to the game, which in turn brings more to the players, which is my ultimate goal. This game has been my baby since 2007, and I am determined to get to the final stage of development to provide a bug-free, action-packed, fun-filled gaming experience that is different for each and every player. I know with your help, we can get there!

 Introduction 
 Hi there, 
 We're Gbrossoft, indie game developers made up of a team of three  (a programmer, an artist and a writer) We've recently started work on a new game 'The Breeding: The fog' scheduled for October 2016 release on Pc and Mac. 
 The Breeding is an open world third person shooter survival game which explores the effect of carbon emissions and climate change on the world. 
 Set sometime in the near future where carbon-monoxide levels have reached unprecedented heights with an increased melting of the ice caps, a ground breaking experiment using genetically modified microbes to break down carbon-monoxide  to less hazardous molecules have been deployed into the atmosphere by world governments. This stride has  proven successful. 
 However, few months down the line, things have gone awry leading to the central theme of the game: 
 Surviving in the persistent fog and erratic weather as well as battling unknown creepy creatures which appear with the fog. 
 Features of the game 
 - Two main story modes and a survival mode 
 - Four playable characters 
 - Night and day cycle 
 - Weather system 
 - Localizations in multiple languages (English, Russian, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish) 
 - Multiple enemy variant (NOTE - a mock up is currently used in the teaser trailer video) 
 - Scavenge for resources 
 - Collaborate with other surviving characters within the game 
 - and more...... 
 What we need the money for 
 Our funding goal is $25000 which would be judiciously deployed in the following areas 
 -Purchase of the full licenses of the softwares and tools being used in the development of this project. 
 -Complete development of all levels/modes of the game as well as polishing. 
 -Develop unique soundtracks for the game(this would be available for download to our top paying contributors) 
 -Create a 3D animated story intro video 
 -Create more unique and edgy enemy creatures of various forms( a mock up is currently used in the trailer) as well as several other ancillary tasks aimed at providing the best user experience during game play 
 The Impact of your help! 
 We are already about 40% through with the game on very little budget. We believe achieving our funding goal would help us complete the project smoothly and on time.

11,1672926,Gamepad CGX,"The story of the project 
 Mobile
 games are the next frontier, with more titles now being released on 
tablet and phones than any other platform. But unlike platforms built 
for gaming, mobile screens and the tiny controls they accommodate can 
get in the way of play. 
 We built CUBE Gamepad CGX01 to make your
 Android tablet or phone a joy to play - and at a very affordable price.
 We've got your PC gaming covered too - with an optional USB 
receiver, the CGX01 is compatible with most PC systems. 
 Ready to enjoy mobile gaming? 
 Thousands of compatible games 
 Use
 your CUBE gamepad with any of the thousands of already compatible games
 available on the CUBE store - or with any mobile or PC game with native
 controller support. 
 Keeping 'em coming 
 Our ongoing
 partnerships with game developers have allowed us to introduce more 
than 100 licensed games, with plans to triple that number in 2016 alone.
 Now, who's still bored? 
 Available games in the store: 
 Works with the works - Android smart phones, tablets, smart TVs and more. 
 The
 CUBE gaming console is the perfect companion to Android phones, 
tablets, TV set top boxes and smart TVs. Simply insert the nano-receiver
 into the tablet or phone's USB port, and set your TV to mirror your 
device for a gaming experience as big as your biggest screen. 
 You can also skip the middleman and get the optional USB receiver, which plugs directly into your computer or smart TV. 
 2.4Ghz RF transmission technology with an 8-metre range. 
 2.4 GHz data transmission delivers a speedy connection over up to 8 metres, with virtually no delays, dropouts or interference. 
 Classic button layout 
 The CUBE
 console uses the classic PS4 button layout, making the transition even 
easier if you already play heavily on a console. 
 Insane durability testing 
 CGX01's reinforced buttons and joysticks have a tested service life exceeding 500,000 presses - we've checked. 
 Anti-slip surface finish 
 Helps you survive the longest gaming session, with contoured rubber grips and anti-slip curves. 
 Low power consumption 
 We chose
 a super energy-efficient chipset for our gamepad to guarantee long 
uninterrupted play, with added intelligent sleep and wake for energy 
saving. 
 Timeline 
 In August of 2015, it launch the project and determine the overall scheme 
 By September of 2015, the specification & sample of CGX01 are completed 
 From October to December of 2015, work with Ugame Team to test the gamepad 
 And in December of 2015 game APK was made 
 From November to December of 2015, beta version was release and tested 
 In March of 2016, it was release on INDIEGOGO for funds 
 June of 2016 onwards a mass production of CGX01 along with the delivery 
 How the funds will be used 
 The funds from this INDIEGOGO will be used to fund the production, as well as continued R&D improvement to the gamepad. 
 If we fail to collect the necessary funds, we will try to get the 
project to the end from own funds . In this case , likely will delay 
about one month production process.And if we have major problems with 
funds or production process ,each donor will receive money back 
guaranteed! Thanks for your support and trust !"" 
 Challenges 
 We
 won't lie - It's not difficult to design the hardware of a gamepad. The
 biggest challenge has been the ability to offer players a rich library 
of games to choose from. Our partnerships with the Ugame Team and 30 
other game developers has helped us overcome this, with 200 new 
licensed game releases planned in 2016. 
 Bluetooth or 2.4G? We 
wanted to create a stable controller at a competitive price. We chose 
2.4G for its plug-and-play functionality, and its ability to offer a 
higher compatibility across a range of devices.",[],True,2016-03-08 13:14:56-08:00,2016-03-23 23:59:59-07:00,5000.0,15,USD
